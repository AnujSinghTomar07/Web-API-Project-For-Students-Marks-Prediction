Project Introduction: Student Study and Performance Analysis
Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between study hours, sleep hours, extracurricular activities, and student performance (marks). By understanding how these factors interact, we aim to identify key factors that significantly impact student achievement.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes data from 20 students and provides the following attributes:

Study Hours: The number of hours spent studying per day.
Sleep Hours: The number of hours spent sleeping per day.
Extracurricular Hours: The number of hours spent on extracurricular activities per day.
Marks: The student's performance score (out of 100), representing their academic achievement.

Analysis Goals:
Correlation Analysis: Determine the correlation between study hours and marks, and how sleep and extracurricular hours influence this relationship.
Regression Modeling: Develop a multiple linear regression model to predict student performance based on study hours, sleep hours, and extracurricular hours.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations for students and educators on optimizing study routines and balancing extracurricular activities to enhance academic performance.

Tools and Techniques:
Data preprocessing and cleaning using Python's Pandas library.
Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand relationships and distributions.
Statistical analysis and regression modeling with Scikit-Learn.
Model evaluation using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
This analysis aims to help students manage their time effectively and understand how different factors impact their academic performance, potentially leading to improved study strategies and better overall results.
